        "desc": "The Mustang is one of the most iconic classic cars ever produced. The Mustang is almost synonymous with the muscle car category, setting the benchmark for what a muscle car should look, sound and feel like.\n\nFord Mustangs continue to push the limits of performance, providing newer and more advanced Mustangs than ever before. Advancements in technology have created a whole new level of performance, boasting specs that could never even be imagined in the Mustangs of old. With the release of the new GT500 Predator engine now publicly available as a crate engine, let's look back at one of the most beautiful vintage Mustangs of all time.\n\nThroughout the history of the Ford Mustang, there has been a multitude of truly iconic performance vehicles, but no list can ever be complete without the 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. The style, the form and the function were all perfected in this glorious muscle car.\n\nSo, let's look at the 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, seeing why it is often regarded as the most beautiful vintage muscle car ever.\n\nHistory And The Adoption Of The Shelby Namesake\n\nSo, why is this vintage muscle car so special, and what is with the Shelby badge?\n\nTo provide a brief overview, Caroll Shelby was a racing enthusiast and competed as a professional driver after his time in the Army Air Corps. After his retirement from racing due to a heart condition, Shelby went on to create performance vehicles for Ford. Shelby created the infamous Mustang GT350 in 1965, setting up the benchmark for consequent Ford performance vehicles. The GT350 was created to directly rival Corvettes, Jaguars and Ferraris in the American B Class Production Vehicles category. The GT350 was insanely successful, not only dominating these vehicles, but also winning the B Production Class National Championship of that very same year.\n\nThe massive success of the GT350 demonstrated Ford's ability to create performance vehicles and made Shelby into a badge of performance for Ford vehicles.\n\nPower And Performance For Days\n\nIn 1967 Caroll Shelby created the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 and literally transformed how muscle cars are understood.\n\nThe chassis was modified slightly to make room for the gigantic 428 big-block V8s that would be housed in the GT500s. Now, if the 428 cubic inch displacement does not mean much to you, remember that the GT500 of 1967 used a 7.0-Liter big-block V8 whereas most modern muscle cars use V8s with displacement values between 5.0-Liters and 6.2-Liters, think Chrysler 300s, Hellcats, Camaros and Corvettes. Furthermore, this absolutely monstrous engine was mated to two 600-CFM Holley carburetors, coming with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic. The engine produced 355 HP and 420 lb-ft of torque. Mechanically, the GT500 was different from other Mustangs in that it featured stiffer front springs, Gabriel shock absorbers and front disc brakes as standard. Additionally, the car also featured aesthetic modifications such as racing stripes, side scoops, Shelby badging, different rear wing and lights.\n\nTalking of performance, there is one truly special GT500 that needs to be mentioned; the 1967 Shelby GT500 Super Snake. There was one, you read that right, only one 1967 Shelby GT500 Super Snake ever created, and it's probably the most beautiful vintage muscle car ever. The Super Snake variant took performance to a whole new level. The heart of this build is a racing-spec 427 V8 taken from a GT40 Mk II, which was normally used in the infamous Ford GT40s that won multiple races. For more details on the GT40s, just watch the new Ford vs Ferrari movie. Interestingly, the car was originally built to be a demonstrator vehicle for the cheaper Goodyear Thunderbolt Tires, which is slightly strange considering the insane performance of the Super Snake. Luckily for us, the only original GT500 Super Snake still exists and has been owned by Richard Ellis since 2019.\n\nProduction Numbers, Modern Pricing And Hollywood Fame\n\nThe 1967 Shelby GT500s are quite a rare vehicle nowadays but are becoming increasingly popular due to various Hollywood features.\n\nArguably, the most infamous '67 Shelby GT500 of all Hollywood is the 'Eleanor' from the film 'Gone In 60 Seconds' from 2000. The Eleanor is a modified Shelby GT500 and while it is not present in the original 1974 film, a lot of the success of the new film is directly attributed to the Eleanor. Another famous film-featured GT500 is the one featured in the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Admittedly, it is not an official Shelby GT500 but a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback with the iconic green and white color combo utilizing the classic Shelby colors on a popular Mustang chassis.\n\nAccording to MustangSpecs there were 2,050 Shelby GT500s made in 1967 and there is no definite indicator of how many are left today. In terms of modern prices, bottom values are around $200,000 and climb as high as $2.2 Million for the 1967 Shelby GT500 Super Snake.",
